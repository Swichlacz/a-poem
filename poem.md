## Laugh And Be Merry
#### By John Masefield

:laughing:

*Laugh and be merry*, **remember**, better the world with a song,<br>
Better the world with a blow in the teeth of a wrong.<br>
Laugh, for the time is brief, a thread the length of a span.<br>
Laugh and be proud to belong to the old proud pageant of man.:man:<br>

*Laugh and be merry*: **remember**, in olden time.<br>
God made Heaven and Earth for joy He took in a rhyme,<br>
Made them, and filled them full with the strong red wine of his mirth<br>
The splendid joy of the stars: the joy of the earth.:earth_americas:<br>

So we must _Laugh and drink_ from the deep blue cup of the sky,<br>
Join the jubilant song of the great stars sweeping by,<br>
Laugh, and battle, and work, and drink of the wine outpoured<br>
In the dear green earth, the sign of the joy of the Lord.:joy:<br>

*Laugh and be merry* **together**, like brothers akin,<br>
Guesting awhile in the rooms of a beautiful inn,<br>
Glad till the dancing stops, and the lilt of the music ends.<br>
Laugh till the game is played; and be you merry, my friends.:two_men_holding_hands:<br>
